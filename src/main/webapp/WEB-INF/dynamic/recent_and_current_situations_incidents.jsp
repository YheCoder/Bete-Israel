            Israel took long to accept their Jewishness in the first place, and it did with hesitation even after Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (Ojanuga 147).
        The term "Falasha Mura" used by Israeli religious leaders to refer to the Bete Israelis as those who abandoned "true Judaism" (Zegeye 361).
        Although Rabbi Yosef "had in 1973 recognised the Beta Israel as Jews, he demanded that they undergo a conversion ceremony to remove
        all doubt" (Zegeye 379). Israel Jews were caught in surprise seeing how different the Bete Israel were; the Felashas did not wear
        "kippot (skullcaps)", tefillin (small leather boxes)â€”neither did they know Israel's holidays like Purim and Hanukkah (Zegeye 376).
        Those who refused to readjust their belief system or "convert were not allowed to be married by the rabbinate" (Zegeye 379).
        "In the early years after Operation Moses (1984) and Operation Solomon (1991), Sephardic Chief Rabbi David Shloush was the only
        one who could act as marriage registrar for the Ethiopian community, should they not choose to undergo a symbolic conversion
        first" (Zegeye 378). Indeed, the qessotch (kessim in Hebrew), Bete Israel leaders, fought very hard to get full rabbinic
        authority which is needed to practice marriage licensing and similar religious rituals (Zegeye 382- 387).
        Furthermore, certain conditions like the fact that Jewish immigrants from Russia, some of whom were non-Jews,
        did not have to go through the symbolic conversion before marriage (Zegeye 381) suggest the presence of "racial" issue.
        As Zegeye states, "Israeli ethnocentrism" underlined the issues faced by the Bete Israel (Zegeye 375). Ojanuga undertook
        a study in which he interviewed 72 Felashas, out of whom 43 were new comers(olim) with an average of 9.4 months in Israel,
        from June to August 1992 from two absorption centers, Shalom Hotel and Hulda caravan, and additional 29 veterans (vatikim)
        with an average of 7.3 years in Israel (Ojanuga 149-150). The interviewees were asked how being "black" affected them and
        whether they experienced discrimination in housing, schools, the military, shops and social events because of their
        skin color (Ojanuga). He concluded that discrimination based on skin color was not a problem; however, 31 percent of
        the vatikim confirmed housing was a problem as some Israeli tenants objected to the presence of Felasha neighbors,
        and 61.1 percent of the veterans indicated they were either treated as backward or reported that "black skin" was
        problematic (Ojanuga 149-152). Of the olim, 34.9 and 9.3 percent viewed the Israelis to have hold positive and negative
        perceptions about the Felashas respectively (Ojanuga 149-152).

        Ojanuga's study is a little old and it might not reflect the current situation of the Bete Israel. However, some
        recent incidents might better reflect the situation. In 2015, mass protests took place because of the surfacing of a video
        showing beating of a Bete Israeli soldier who served in<br>

        <br>Israel's Defense Force by "white" police (Mitnick); the video shows
        no illegal action from the soldier's part that could have led to the beating. Nonetheless, the protests were not triggered
        by one incident, but, as the Israeli president Reuven Rivlin put it, by the "pain[s] of a community crying out over a sense
        of discrimination, racism, and of being unanswered" (Mitnick).
