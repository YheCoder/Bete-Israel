            The Bete Israel endured a terrible situation that was polarized by the regional
                and world politics at the time (1984 - 1991).
           </li><br>
            <li>
            The politics and the proselytization by the AAEJ (American Association for Ethiopian Jews) served as the
            main driving forces for the emigration of Bete Israel.

            <li>
            Drought and internal discrimination at home played a lesser role.

            <li>
                Israel's motive to airlift the Felashas were more of political rather than religious. If it were
                religious, they would not have undergone symbolic conversion when they arrived in Israel.
