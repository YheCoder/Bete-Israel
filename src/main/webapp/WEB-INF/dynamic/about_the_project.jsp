        <h2>From Zion to Israel: Ethiopian Jews' Immigration to Israel</h2>
        <p><span style="font-size:21pt">
            "The ingathering of Black Jews to Israel is one of the most unique phenomena of modem day Black history for two
            reasons; first, the Jews of Ethiopia are the only group of Africans practicing Judaism and second, they are the
            only group of Africans who have migrated to a predominately White society for religious reasons"(Ojanuga 147).
            <br><br>
            In this project, a brief history of Bete Israel (also known as Falashas), the socio-economic and political
            turmoil that led to their airlifting and continued migration to Israel, their experience in Israel  as Jews of
            Ethiopian origin and their current struggles with problems they face are briefly examined.
