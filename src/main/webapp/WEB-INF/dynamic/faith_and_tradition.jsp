        <h3>Faith and Tradtion</h3>
        <p>
        Bete Israel did not call themselves Felasha. And until recently, the Felasha did not call themselves
        Jewish people; "American activists invented the term `Ethiopian Jews`, and by mid-1970s the Bete Israel
        had adopted it" (Spector 7).  Nonetheless, <br>
        "their religion was based on the Bible and other sacred writings translated into Ge’ez. Their canon included
        the entire Old Testament, as well as apocrypha and pseudepigrapha, including the books of Enoch and Jubilees.
        They were unaware of the Talmud, or rabbinic tradition, or even Hebrew. They did not know Hanukkah or the joyous
        celebration of Purim. They had no bar mitzvahs, kipot (skullcaps), or prayer shawls, and they did not light
        Sabbath candles." (Spector 6-7). <br>
        Although the Tewahido Christians observe the Sabbath (Saturday), almost as much as they do Sunday,
        the Felashas observe the Sabbath differently. The Bete Israel ritually cleanse themselves and extinguish
        all fires on Friday afternoons; they avoid "sex on Sabbath evening—unlike normative Orthodox Jews, for whom
        marital sex on Friday nights is highly appropriate (and a particular obligation for scholars, according to the
        Talmud)" (Spector 7). The Tewahedo Christians also abstain from sex on Saturday and Sunday, but they don’t do
        the others. What is even more interesting is the Felasha practices are very different than other Jewish
        practices. "And, though they had no rabbis, they venerated white-turbaned priests called qessotch (qessim
        in Hebrew)" (Spector 7). Perhaps, that was why most "Western Jews did not accept the Falashas as authentically
        Jewish" (Spector 8). Their unique practices lasted till the westerns began giving attention. Particularly, the
        travel of Halevy and later Jacques Faitlovitch to Ethiopia brought attention to the world and hence westernization
        of the Bete Israel began, for "Faitlovitch brought mainstream Jewish practices and opened school in Addis Ababa"
        (Spector 8).
